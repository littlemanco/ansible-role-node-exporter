## https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases
node_exporter_version: "0.14.0"

## The architecture that the node exporter supports. The exporter is built for a series of architectures; see the above
## releases link for further details
node_exporter_arch: "amd64"

## The checksum algorithm to check the release against. See the following URL for a list of options:
## http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/stat_module.html
node_exporter_checksum_algorithm: "sha512"

## There are two checksums that matter: The archive, and the binary. The binary is the executable node exporter,
## the archive the thing it's downloaded with.

## Prometheus supports exporting metrics for things like cronjobs to a specific location on disk, where the node
## exporter will later pick them up. The path below is the the location the metrics are expected to appear, in the
## prometheus format.
##
## It is created with liberal permissions, so any process can export metrics to it.
